# simplest-fetch
The simplest fetch program you'll ever find, written in C. No seriously, this is what it looks like:

You can use the `-i` flag for base 1024 units (KiB, MiB, GiB, etc). By default the program uses base 1000 units like above (KB, MB, GB, etc).

To use this little program just clone and run the build script, an executable will appear in a new `build/` directory! I might also make releases. For both of these the only platform I'm going to actively support is linux, chances are it'll work on BSD distros but I'm not sure, same with macOS.
